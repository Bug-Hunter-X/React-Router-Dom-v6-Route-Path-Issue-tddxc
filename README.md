# React Router Dom v6 Route Path Issue
This repository demonstrates a seemingly simple issue with React Router Dom v6 where a specific route fails to render its component despite no apparent errors.  The problem lies in a subtle conflict or oversight that isn't immediately obvious in the component structure or routing setup.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code. The solution, with explanation, is provided in `AppSolution.js`.
