```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* Solution: Ensure the Contact route is correctly defined and positioned*/}
        <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

function Home() { return <div>Home</div>; }
function About() { return <div>About</div>; }
function Contact() { return <div>Contact</div>; }

export default App;
```
The issue was likely caused by a seemingly correct path but had a subtle naming conflict or an issue with component rendering.  The solution involves double-checking the path, component, and order of routes within the `Routes` component.  In this case, the problem was resolved by carefully reviewing the component code and verifying that the component associated with the problematic route ('/contact') is correctly defined and included in the project.
